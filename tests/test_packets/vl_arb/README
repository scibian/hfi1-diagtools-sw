This directory contains scripts and other files for testing VL Arbitration
(Quality of Service) on the IBA7322.

The test spec is in the .xls file, prepared by Ian Colloff.
vlp_* files are packet descriptions for ipath_pkt_send
vla_* are shell scripts to run the test. vla_test is the "top"
vlt_* are individual test desciptors

It is still a Work In Progress, as two tests (vlt_8_mix and vlt_2052_priority)
still fail.
