The files in this directory are intended to test the response to
various packets. Some are scripts:

pkt_probe uses ipath_pkt_send to send a packet on an interface assumed to
	be in loopback, gathers the various counter changes, and compares
	them to the expected counters.
	The expected counters are passed to it in the form of a symbol,
	QIB_EXPECTED_CNTRS e.g.
	QIB_EXPECTED_CNTRS="RxDlidFltr=2 RxEBP=2"

prep_pkt_vars is common code to set up various symbols. It is sourced by
	other scripts for ease in maintenance. Among other things, it
	tries to detect the chip type so tests can account for variations.

*_pkt_cntr_test scripts check classes of counters. Each can be run individually,
or they can be run in sequence by pkt_cntr_suite

basic_pkt_cntr_test --- simple packet and word counts

lenfmt_pkt_cntr_test --- Length errors, VL errors, etc.

lli_pkt_cntr_test --- tests Local Link Integrity, PhyErr Threshold, etc.

pkt_cntr_suite -- runs all in sequence.

tests use pkt_probe to run the individual tests, which differ depending
on the chip type under test.

The rest are packet files, as described by man (5) ipath_pkt_files. Their names
are intended to convey their contents. In particular, a file ending in _egp
will be sent in TestMode to prevent Tx checks from suppressing it, while a
file ending in _mayebp may provoke a Tx error on some chips. Not all files
are used (currently) by pkt_cntr_test, but may prove useful for one-off
testing.
