 by You or any third party even if the modification and Derivative Works are
 permitted under this Agreement.
 .
 3. LIMITATIONS.
 .
 3.1 The consideration under this Agreement is only for the licenses that Intel
 expressly grants to You in Section 2. Any other rights including, but not limited
 to, additional patent rights, will require an additional license and additional
 consideration. Nothing in this Agreement requires or will be treated to require
 Intel to grant any additional license. You acknowledge that an essential basis
 of the bargain in this Agreement is that Intel grants You no licenses or other
 rights including, but not limited to, patent, copyright, trademark, trade name,
 service mark or other intellectual property licenses or rights with respect to
 the Software and Documentation, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, except
 for the licenses expressly granted in Section 2. Specifically, except for the
 licenses that Intel expressly granted You in Section 2, Intel grants no licenses
 or other rights, expressly or by implication, estoppel or otherwise, to:
 .
 (A) make, use, sell, offer for sale, or import modifications of the Software;
 (B) sell or offer to sell the Software;
 (C) combine the Software or modified versions of the Software with other items
 or to use any such combination; or
 (D) any claims of any patents, patent applications, or other patent rights of
 Intel other than the Licensed Patent Claims.
 .
 3.2 You acknowledge that there are significant uses of the Software in its
 original, unmodified and uncombined form. The consideration for the license
 in this Agreement reflects Intel's continuing right to assert patent claims
 against any modifications or Derivative Works (including, without limitation,
 error corrections and bug fixes) of, or combinations with, the Software that
 You or third parties make that infringe any Intel patent claim.
 .
 4. RESTRICTIONS. The license granted under Section 2 of this Agreement is
 subject to these conditions:
 A. You must copy all copyright legends, trademarks, trade names and other
 legends and identification when You copy the Software.
 B. You may not copy the Documentation except for a reasonable number of
 printed copies that You produce for internal use only.
 C. You may not disassemble, decompile or otherwise reverse engineer the Software.
 D. You may not sublicense the Software.
 E. The Software may include portions offered on terms in addition to those set
 out here, as set out in a license accompanying those portions.
 .
 5. OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE. You may not subject the Software, in whole or in part,
 to any license obligations of Open Source Software including without limitation
 combining or distributing the Software with Open Source Software in a manner
 that subjects the Software or any portion of the Software provided by Intel
 hereunder to any license obligations of such Open Source Software. In the event
 Open Source Software is included with the Software, such Open Source Software is
 licensed pursuant to the applicable Open Source Software license agreement
 identified in the Open Source Software comments in the applicable Source Code
 file(s) and/or File Header provided with the Software. Additional detail may
 be provided (where applicable) in the accompanying on-line documentation. With
 respect to the Open Source Software, nothing in this Agreement limits any rights
 under, or grants rights that supersede, the terms of any applicable Open Source
 Software license agreement
 .
 6. NO OTHER RIGHTS. The Software is protected by the intellectual property laws
 of the United States and other countries, and international treaty provisions.
 Except as otherwise expressly above, Intel grants no express or implied rights
 under Intel patents, copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights.
 Except as expressly stated in this Agreement, no license or right is granted to You
 directly or by implication, inducement, estoppel or otherwise. Intel shall have the
 right to inspect or have an independent auditor inspect Your relevant records to
 verify Your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
 .
 7. CONFIDENTIALITY. The Software is confidential information of Intel and its
 licensors and will be governed by the terms of the Corporate Non-Disclosure
 Agreement ("CNDA") between Intel and You. If You wish to have a third party
 consultant or subcontractor ("Contractor") perform work on Your behalf which
 involves access to or use of Software, You will obtain a written confidentiality
 agreement from the Contractor which contains terms and obligations with respect
 to access to or use of Software no less restrictive than those set forth in this
 Agreement and the CNDA, excluding any distribution rights, and use for any other
 purpose, and protects the confidential portions of the Software from disclosure
 to third parties. Otherwise, You will not disclose the terms or existence of this
 Agreement or use Intel's Name in any publications, advertisements, or other
 announcements without Intel's prior written consent. You do not have any rights
 to use any Intel trademarks or logos.
 .
 8. OWNERSHIP OF SOFTWARE AND COPYRIGHTS. Title to all copies of the Software
 remains with Intel or its suppliers. The Software is copyrighted and protected
 by the laws of the United States and other countries, and international treaty
 provisions. You may not remove any copyright notices from the Software. Intel
 may make changes to the Software, or to items referenced therein, at any time
 without notice, but is not obligated to support or update the Software. Except
 as otherwise expressly provided, Intel grants no express or implied right under
 Intel patents, copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights.
 You may transfer the Software only if the recipient agrees to be fully bound by
 these terms and if you retain no copies of the Software.
 .
 9. SUPPORT. Intel may make changes to the Software, or to items referenced therein,
 at any time without notice, but is not obligated to support, update or provide
 training for the Software. Intel may in its sole discretion offer such services
 under separate terms at Intel's then-current rates. You may request additional
 information on Intel's service offerings from an Intel sales representative. You
 agree to be solely responsible to Your End Users for any update or support
 obligation or other liability which may arise from the distribution of the Software,
 if permitted under this Agreement.
 .
 10. EXCLUSION OF OTHER WARRANTIES. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY
 EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF ANY KIND INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
 NONINFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Intel does not warrant or
 assume responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any information, text,
 graphics, links or other items contained within the Software.
 .
 11. Limitation of Liability. The software licensed hereunder is not designed or
 intended for use in any medical, life saving or life sustaining systems,
 transportation systems, nuclear systems, or for any other mission critical
 application in which the failure of the software could lead to personal injury
 or death. Intel will not be liable for any damages whatsoever including costs
 of procurement of substitutes, loss of profits, loss of use, interruption of
 business, or for any other special, consequential, punitive or incidental
 damages, however caused, whether for breach of warranty, contract, tort,
 negligence, strict liability or otherwise, irrespective of whether Intel has
 advance notice of the possibility of such damages. Intel's cumulative liability
 to You for all claims of any kind resulting from the Software furnished under
 this Agreement, will not exceed one thousand US Dollars ($1000), regardless of
 whether Intel has been advised of the possibility of those damages or whether
 any remedy set forth in this Agreement fails of its essential purpose or
 otherwise. This limitation of liability is cumulative and not per incident; the
 existence of more than one claim will not increase the limit. The limitation of
 liability set forth in this Section 11 is a fundamental basis of this Agreement;
 and each Party understands and agrees that the other would not have entered into
 this Agreement without the limitation of liability.
 .
 12. TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT. Intel may terminate this Agreement immediately,
 upon notice from Intel, if You violate its terms. Upon termination, You will immediately
 destroy the Software (including providing certification of such destruction back to Intel)
 or return all copies of the Software to Intel. In the event of termination of this
 Agreement, all licenses granted to You hereunder shall immediately terminate, except
 for licenses that you have previously distributed to Your end-users pursuant to the
 license grant above.
 .
 13. APPLICABLE LAWS. Any claims arising under or relating to this Agreement will be
 governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Delaware or federal courts
 located in Delaware, without regard to principles of conflict of laws. Each Party hereby
 agrees to jurisdiction and venue in the courts of the State of California for all
 disputes and litigation arising under or relating to this Agreement. The Parties agree
 that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
 specifically excluded from application to this Agreement. The Parties consent to the
 personal jurisdiction of the above courts.
 .
 14. EXPORT. You acknowledge that the Software, Documentation and all related technical
 information or materials is subject to export controls under the laws and regulations
 of the United States and any other applicable governments. You agree to comply with these
 laws and regulations governing export, re-export, import, transfer, distribution, and use
 of the Software, Documentation and all related technical information or materials. In
 particular, but without limitation, the Software, Documentation and all related
 technical information or materials may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any U.S.
 embargoed countries or (b) to any person or entity listed on a denial order published
 by the U.S. government or any other applicable governments. By using the Software,
 Documentation and all related technical information or materials, you represent and
 warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list. You also agree
 that you will not use the Software, Documentation and all related technical information
 or materials for any purposes prohibited by the U.S. government or other applicable
 governments' laws, including, without limitation, the development, design, manufacture or
 production of nuclear, missile, chemical or biological weapons. You confirm that the
 Software, Documentation and all related technical information or materials will not be
 re-exported or sold to a third party who is known or suspected to be involved in
 activities including, without limitation, the development, design, manufacture, or
 production of nuclear, missile, chemical or biological weapons. You agree that
 Software, Documentation and all related technical information or materials subject
 to control under defense laws and regulations (e.g., the International Traffic in
 Arms Regulations [ITAR]) must not be transferred to non-U.S. persons, whether
 located in the U.S. or abroad, without a government license. You will indemnify
 Intel against any loss related to Your failure to conform to these requirements
 .
 15. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS. U.S. Government Contract Provisions. This Agreement
 is a temporary license of the Software for Your internal use. No Government
 procurement regulation or contract clauses or provision will be considered a
 part of any transaction between the Parties under this Agreement unless its
 inclusion is required by statute, or mutually agreed upon in writing by the
 Parties in connection with a specific transaction. The technical data and computer
 Software covered by this license is a "Commercial Item," as that term is defined
 by the FAR 2.101 (48 C.F.R. 2.101) and is "commercial computer software" and
 "commercial computer software documentation" as specified under FAR 12.212
 (48 C.F.R. 12.212) or DFARS 227.7202 (48 C.F.R. 227.7202), as applicable. This
 commercial computer software and related documentation is provided to end users
 for use by and on behalf of the U.S. Government, with only those rights as are
 granted to all other end users under the terms and conditions in this Agreement.
 Use for or on behalf of the U.S. Government is permitted only if the party
 acquiring or using this Software is properly authorized by an appropriate U.S.
 Government official. This use by or for the U.S. Government clause is in lieu of,
 and supersedes, any other FAR, DFARS, or other provision that addresses Government
 rights in the computer Software or documentation covered by this license. All
 copyright licenses granted to the U.S. Government are coextensive with the technical
 data and computer software licenses granted in this Agreement. The U.S. Government
 will only have the right to reproduce, distribute, perform, display, and prepare
 derivative works as needed to implement those rights
 .
 16. ASSIGNMENT. You may not delegate, assign or transfer this Agreement, or any of
 Your rights and obligations under this Agreement, whether by contract, operation of
 law, acquisition, merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of Your
 outstanding shares or assets, other changes in control, or any other event, and
 any attempt to do so will be a material breach of this Agreement and will be null
 and void. In addition, You may not sublicense, assign or transfer any Software,
 Documentation, Confidential Information or any part of the Software, Documentation
 or Confidential Information, or any right in this Agreement, whether by contract,
 operation of law, acquisition, merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially
 all of a party's outstanding shares or assets, other changes in control, or any
 other event, to any third party temporarily (such as loaning, rental, licensing
 or timeshare) or permanently, except as expressly permitted under Section 2
 without the prior written consent of Intel in each instance (which consent Intel
 may withhold in its sole discretion). Any attempted sublicense, assignment or
 transfer that is not expressly permitted under Section 2 or is without consent
 will be a material breach of this Agreement and will be null and void. Subject
 to the other provisions of this Section 15, this Agreement will bind and inure to
 the benefit of the Parties and their permitted successors and assigns
 .
 17. Entire Agreement. The terms and conditions of this Agreement constitutes the
 entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof,
 and merges and supersedes all prior, contemporaneous agreements, understandings,
 negotiations and discussions. Neither of the parties hereto shall be bound by any
 conditions, definitions, warranties, understandings or representations with
 respect to the subject matter hereof other than as expressly provided for
 herein. Intel is not obligated under any other agreements unless they are in
 writing and signed by an authorized representative of Intel.
 .
 18. Attorneys' Fees. In the event any proceeding or lawsuit is brought by Intel
 or You in connection with this Agreement, the prevailing party in such proceeding
 shall be entitled to receive its costs, expert witness fees and reasonable
 attorneys' fees, including costs and fees on appeal.
 .
 19. No Agency. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as creating any agency,
 employment relationship, partnership, principal-agent or other form of joint
 enterprise between the parties.
 .
 20. Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be
 unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law or be so held by applicable
 court decision, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this
 Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and, in such event, such provision
 shall be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such
 unenforceable or invalid provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable
 court decisions.
 .
 21. Waiver. The failure of either party to require performance by the other party
 of any provision hereof shall not affect the full right to require such
 performance at any time thereafter; nor shall the waiver by either party of a
 breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of the provision
 itself.
 .
 22. Language. This Agreement is in the English language only, which language shall
 be controlling in all respects, and all versions of this Agreement in any other
 language shall be for accommodation only and shall not be binding on you or Intel.
 All communications and notices made or given pursuant to this Agreement, and all
 documentation and support to be provided, unless otherwise noted, shall be in the
